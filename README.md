# Battleship OOP

## About the project
The task was to implement console battleship game for two players. To do that, we had to understand OOP princliples i.e. classes with fields, methods and properties, grouped in namespaces, using proper access modifiers, using inheritance and polymorphism wherever possible.
In this project we interacted with UML diagrams for the first time.
